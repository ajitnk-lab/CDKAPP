# CDK Application Deployment Guide

This repository contains a CDK (Cloud Development Kit) application for deploying AWS resources. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and deploy the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- AWS CLI

## Setup and Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required Python dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install the AWS CDK CLI**

   ```
   npm install -g aws-cdk
   ```

5. **Configure your AWS credentials**

   If you haven't already set up your AWS credentials, run:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and preferred region when prompted.

6. **Synthesize the CloudFormation template**

   ```
   cdk synth --app "python app.py"
   ```
   This command will show you the CloudFormation template that will be used to create your AWS resources. Note the `--app "python app.py"` parameter, which explicitly specifies the entry point for your CDK application.

7. **Bootstrap your AWS environment (if you haven't already)**

   If this is your first time using CDK with your AWS account in this region, you need to bootstrap:
   ```
   cdk bootstrap --app "python app.py"
   ```

8. **Deploy the stack**

   ```
   cdk deploy --app "python app.py"
   ```
   Review the proposed changes and type 'y' when prompted to confirm the deployment.

## Additional Information

- The main CDK application code is in the `app.py` file.
- To make changes to the infrastructure, modify the `app.py` file and re-run the `cdk deploy` command.
- To destroy the created resources, run `cdk destroy --app "python app.py"`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, please check the following:

- Ensure all prerequisites are correctly installed.
- Verify that your AWS credentials are correctly configured.
- Check that you have the necessary permissions in your AWS account.
- If you're having trouble with CDK commands, always use the `--app "python app.py"` parameter to explicitly specify the entry point.
